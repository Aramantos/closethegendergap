        <h1>Welcome to <span>VR=</span></h1>
        <p class="p1">As you are all aware, We have been given many different costumes in this mascarade called
        life. Throughout the ages, some costumes were considered inferior, insignificant and sometimes
        even unacceptable. But deep down, we know that WE ARE ALL EQUAL!</p>

        <p class="p2">Our socioeconomic background may define our beginnings but not our ends. Our attitude and the
        power of will is going to determine which way we stir the ship. Gender has nothing to do with how
        well one can perform his or her job, but the burning passion and the love for their work
        is what leaves the inprint on the society. Some of the greatest people that have walked among us
        have had similar values, strenghts and virtues. One thing they all had in common was the power
        of their imagination. They had an ability to make their internal world more real to them than external.
        Their visions were charged with such an amplitude of emotion that nothing or no-one could change what
        they have felt and held in their mind's eye, and with the persistance and persavirance they have overcame
        most horendous obstalces and setbacks. That, well, that is called greatness. No matter where you're
        from, no matter what color of your skin is, no matter what gender or what religion you belong to
        You have the greatness within yourself!</p>

        <p class="p3">in VR= our aim is to make you feel better, but also help you understand that only the sky is the limit!
        If you can hold it in your mind, you can hold it in your hands, and what else could back up this 
        statement more than real examples of most amazing people we have been gifted with! If you follow their patterns
        and hold tight on your journey, you may accomplish what they have and much more!
        </p>

        about their personalities, adversities and what they have done in order to overcome them.

                <p>Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and to have published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is often regarded as the first computer programmer.</p>

                <p>Alan Turing was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist. Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer. He is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.</p>

                <p>Marie Curie was a Polish and naturalized-French physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering research on radioactivity. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person and the only woman to win the Nobel Prize twice, and the only person to win the Nobel Prize in two scientific fields. Her husband, Pierre Curie, was a co-winner on her first Nobel Prize, making them the first ever married couple to win the Nobel Prize and launching the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes. She was, in 1906, the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris.</p>

            <h1>Unconscious Bias</h1>
            <p class="p1">
                Implicit bias is an automatic reaction we have towards other people.
            </p>
            <p class="p2">
                These attitudes and stereotypes can negatively impact our understanding, actions, and decision-making. 
                The idea that we can hold prejudices we don’t want or believe was quite radical when it was first introduced, 
                and the fact that people may discriminate unintentionally continues to have implications for understanding 
                disparities in so many aspects of society, including but not limited to health care, policing, and education, 
                as well as organizational practices like hiring and promotion.
            </p>
            <p class="p3">
                To help people better understand these subconscious beliefs, an "Implicit Association Test" (IAT) has been developed.
                measures attitudes and beliefs that people may be unwilling or unable to report. The IAT may be especially interesting 
                if it shows that you have an implicit attitude that you did not know about. For example, you may believe that women and 
                men should be equally associated with science, but your automatic associations could show that you (like many others) 
                associate men with science more than you associate women with science.
            </p>
            <p class="p4">
                For more information on the IAT and to take a test yourself, you can go <a href="https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/" target="_blank">here</a>.
