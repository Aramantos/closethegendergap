        <h1>Welcome to <span>VR=</span></h1>
        <p class="p1">As you are all aware, We have been given many different costumes in this mascarade called
        life. Throughout the ages, some costumes were considered inferior, insignificant and sometimes
        even unacceptable. But deep down, we know that WE ARE ALL EQUAL!</p>

        <p class="p2">Our socioeconomic background may define our beginnings but not our ends. Our attitude and the
        power of will is going to determine which way we stir the ship. Gender has nothing to do with how
        well one can perform his or her job, but the burning passion and the love for their work
        is what leaves the inprint on the society. Some of the greatest people that have walked among us
        have had similar values, strenghts and virtues. One thing they all had in common was the power
        of their imagination. They had an ability to make their internal world more real to them than external.
        Their visions were charged with such an amplitude of emotion that nothing or no-one could change what
        they have felt and held in their mind's eye, and with the persistance and persavirance they have overcame
        most horendous obstalces and setbacks. That, well, that is called greatness. No matter where you're
        from, no matter what color of your skin is, no matter what gender or what religion you belong to
        You have the greatness within yourself!</p>

        <p class="p3">in VR= our aim is to make you feel better, but also help you understand that only the sky is the limit!
        If you can hold it in your mind, you can hold it in your hands, and what else could back up this 
        statement more than real examples of most amazing people we have been gifted with! If you follow their patterns
        and hold tight on your journey, you may accomplish what they have and much more!
        </p>

        <p class="p4">Further down the page you will be able to browse through the selection of role-models, learn
        about their personalities, adversities and what they have done in order to overcome them.
