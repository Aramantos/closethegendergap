## Concept

Women are significantly underrepresented in the science, technology, engineering and maths (“STEM”) workforce. [According to Eurostat](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/02/women-gender-technology-economy-representation-equality), women hold only 17% of major technology jobs, such as programming, systems analysis, or software development.

One reason for this is that visibility of women and minorities in STEM fields is often limited, "it's hard to be what you can't see".

Greater awareness of women and minorities in these areas can help to increase the ability of these groups to consider STEM fields as viable career options. Knowledge of female role models has also been demonstrated to reduce the implicit biases that are shown via studies to be present in both men and women.

Much more detail on this topic is available [in this report](https://www.aauw.org/app/uploads/2020/03/Solving-the-Equation-report-nsa.pdf) by the AAUW, a non-profit organisation in the USA that advances equity for women and girls through advocacy, education, and research.

Someone Like You therefore aims to provide a diverse range of examples of successful people, ...

## Design

The project has been designed according to the five planes of content strategy. Further details are below:

### Plane 1: Strategy

### Plane 2: Scope

Our team identified a number of possible features for the project. We focused on initially creating a minimum viable product ("MVP"), with other features to be added at a later date if time allowed:

- Information on a range of diverse people who have been successful at what they do
    - importance 5
    - viability 5
- Calendar featuring a different person for each day of the year
    - importance x
    - viability x
- Quiz on different people and what they have accomplished
    - importance x
    - viability x
- Information on how a range of specific diversity-related issues have been overcome
    - importance x
    - viability x
- Information on unconscious bias and links to external site(s) with more information
    - importance x
    - viability x
- Unconscious bias test

## Deployment

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages. The steps taken to deploy are:
- In the GitHub repository for the site, click on the ‘Settings’ tab along the top of the page.
- This brings up a General Settings page with a selection of menu items down the left-hand side.
- In this new menu, click on “Pages”.
- In the main body of the page, it is then possible to select a branch. Select the main branch. Click on “Save”.
- GitHub then provides a link to the published webpage, which can be clicked or copied and pasted like any other link.
- Further updates that are pushed to the branch will automatically appear in GitHub Pages.

### Forking a GitHub repository

It is possible to copy the repository in order to experiment with your own changes without affecting the original project. The steps to do this as as follows:
- Navigate to the GitHub website.
- Log in if necessary.
- Navigate to the repository that you want to fork.
- In the top right-hand corner of the page, click on "fork".
- You will be taken to a page to create your own fork. You can edit the project name and (optionally) add a description.
- Click on "create fork" to complete the process.

### Cloning a GitHub repository

It is also possible to copy the repository onto your own local machine. In practice, this might be done to make it easier to fix merge conflicts, add or remove files, and push larger commits. To do this, follow these steps:
- Navigate to the GitHub website.
- Log in if necessary.
- Navigate to the repository that you want to clone.
- Above the list of files, find the "Code" button and click on it:

- To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", click the clipboard icon. To clone the repository using an SSH key, including a certificate issued by your organization's SSH certificate authority, click Use SSH, then click the clipboard icon. To clone a repository using GitHub CLI, click Use GitHub CLI, then click the clipboard icon.
- Open your computer terminal.
- Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
- Type "git clone" and then paste the location that you have copied.
- Press "enter" and your local clone will be created.
